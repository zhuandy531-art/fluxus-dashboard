"""Stockbee 5-Day Breadth Ratio Screener.

Counts stocks gaining >= 4 % and losing >= 4 % in a single session,
then computes a rolling 5-day ratio of gainers to losers.  A ratio
above 3.0 signals a breadth thrust; below 0.5 signals a collapse.

History is persisted in a JSON file so that the pipeline can compute
the trailing 5-day window across consecutive daily runs.
